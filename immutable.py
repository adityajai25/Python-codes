# Tuples are immutable because the tuple object doesnot support assignment of any elements to any particular index
# inorder to change the value of a particular index we need to create a new tuple object and assign it to the old tuple object

# Immutable is a property of an object that cannot be changed once it is created. to change the value of a particular index we need to reassign the tuple to same tuple object. 
# Immutable objects include sets and tuples.
